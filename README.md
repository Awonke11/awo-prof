# Awonke Mnotoza Online Portfolio 
- That time of the season where I need a job as a student. I would just create a CV with a gitHub link to my projetcs but that is not what I wanted.
- I want to stand out as a person and make that first impression count to Recruiters 
- Creating this portfolio is a way of expressing myself and showing what I can do with what I know

## Challengies Faced 
1. Creating the contact form with email-js and connecting it to my site
2. Styling the responsive navigation
